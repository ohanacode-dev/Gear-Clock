# Gear-Clock

A 3D printed gear clock using a stepper motor and ESP8266 WiFi module to synchronize time with internet. 
Not yet finished.

For now I have a preliminary FreeCad design of gears an an untested microcontroller firmware to remember 
the last time the minute hand was moved so it can continue in case of power failure.
